  ## Data Collection
  Hoverscope does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data.

  ## Data Storage
  The extension stores telescope specification data locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data contains only scientific
   information about telescopes and satellites (names, specifications, descriptions) and does not include any user data.

  ## Network Requests
  The extension makes requests to GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nataliehogg/hoverscope/) solely to fetch updated telescope
  database information. No user data is sent with these requests.

  ## Third Parties
  Hoverscope does not share any data with third parties. The extension operates entirely on arXiv.org pages and does not track your
  browsing activity.
